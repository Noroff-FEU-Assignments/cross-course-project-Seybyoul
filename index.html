    <p id="web-security-answer">
        Protect yourself from cyberattacks.
        To prevent hacking, it is recommended to avoid using simple passwords.
        Enabling dual authentication reduces the risk of being hacked by additional authentication processes when logging in to your account. This is because you can log in only if you pass dual authentication directly on your cell phone or other means.
        Vaccine software should be used to prevent the device from being infected with a virus. You should also conduct regular updates to respond to the latest threats.
        Keep track of the most popular threats (the current OWASP list is here) and address the most common vulnerabilities first.
